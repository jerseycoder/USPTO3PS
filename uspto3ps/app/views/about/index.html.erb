<h2 style="margin-left: 200px;"> About PatentBat </h2>
<p style="margin-left: 200px;">PatentBat is an online tool which helps people interact with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) to improve patent quality.
<p style="margin-left: 200px;"><b>Background:</b> Third parties (that is, the general public or people other than the folks filing for a patent) have previously been able to file/submit with the USPTO "prior art" or documents/references/other proof that an idea existed <u>before</u> a patent application was filed. But in the past, what was done with these prior art submissions was very little.

Essentially there are (soon to be were in part) three ways in which third parties could submit prior art:
(note that this comparison assumes a first submission by the third party, and that the third party has no access to the patent application before it publishes)
<ul style="margin-left: 200px;">
  <li>Protests by the public against pending applications under <%= link_to "37 CFR \&\#167;1.291".html_safe, "http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/pac/mpep/documents/1900_1901.htm" %> (rule 291). When: Before application publishes. USPTO Fee: None.</li>
  <li>Public use proceedings under <%= link_to "37 CFR &#167;1.292".html_safe, "http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/pac/mpep/documents/appxr_1_292.htm#cfr37s1.292" %> (rule 292). When: Before application publishes. USPTO Fee: $1,510.00.</li>
  <li>Third-party submission in published application under <%= link_to "37 CFR &#167;1.99".html_safe, "http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/pac/mpep/documents/appxr_1_99.htm" %>  (rule 99). When: Up to 2 months after application publishes. USPTO Fee: $180.00.</li>
</ul>

<p style="margin-left: 200px;">Out of these above three ways, only one is practically available to the general public: Rule 99 - Third-party submission in a published application. This is because under <%= link_to "37 U.S.C. &#167;122".html_safe, "http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/pac/mpep/documents/appxl_35_U_S_C_122.htm" %>, patent applications are kept confidential and secret to the public until they are published. If the contents of a patent application are secret until it is published, then the first time that the public learns about a patent application and is able to read and consider the content of the patent application is only <u>after</u> it has published. Therefore, rule 291 and 292 proceedings are, as a practical matter, not available to the public since they require the submissions to occur <u>before</u> publication. Thus, rule 99 proceedings are the only practical proceeding available to the public for submitting prior art.
<p style="margin-left: 200px;">However, the present rule 99 presents several barriers. 1) It costs $180.00; 2) People only have two months after the patent application publishes to file the prior art with the USPTO; and 3) Submissions must be made without comment - and this means that relevant passages of a prior art document cannot even be highlighted or underlined. 

<P style="margin-left: 200px;"><b>The Law:</b> Fortunately, rule 99 is set to be replaced by a better rule. As part of Section 8 of the Americans Invent Act, on January 5, 2012 the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) in the Federal Register proposed a new and improved <%= link_to "37 CFR &#167;1.290".html_safe, "https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2012/01/05/2011-33811/changes-to-implement-the-preissuance-submissions-by-third-parties-provision-of-the-leahy-smith#h-7" %> (to replace rule 99) for third party pre-issuance submissions of prior art in patent applications of others. 35 U.S.C. &#167;122(e) will be effective as of September 16, 2012, and will be usable against any pending applications [including reissues but not reexaminations] filed before or after that date. The new rule 290 sets forth third party submissions as follows: 1) 1.290(g) states that submission is free for up to 3 references total per application; 2) People have the later of six months after publication or the date of the first office action; and 3) it is required that a concise description of the relevance of each prior art reference is submitted.
<p style="margin-left: 200px;"><b>Notes about New Rule 99:</b> While it is free for a third party to submit up to 3 references per application, the third parties submitting prior art separately for the same patent application must not be in <%= link_to "privity", "http://dictionary.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/results.pl?co=dictionary.findlaw.com&topic=31/310f117c83da70f2987351c8893ce99d" %> with each other.
<P style="margin-left: 200px;"><b>The Tools:</b> Now that the public is more empowered to submit prior art references to arguably meritless patent applications (that is, patent applications that are <%= link_to "obvious or not novel", "http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/pac/mpep/documents/0700_706_02.htm#sect706.02" %>), the question becomes - how to do it easily? First, people need to know what patent applications have entered into the period of time for which third party submissions under rule 290 can be made. Second, people need easy access to the patent applications so that they can be read and thoughtfully considered. Finally, people need to know how much time they have to submit prior art references so priority and deadlines can be established.
<P style="margin-left: 200px;">Enter PatentBat. With its upcoming Beta release, PatentBat will search the USPTO public PAIR website (all public information / non-confidential) for pending patent applications, and specifically those that have been published for less than 6 months. It provides easy, clickable links to these patent applications, and saving features so that registered users can "watch" certain applications so that they can return to these watched apps and continue review, or be sent notifications when events in the file wrapper of these applications have been noted within the USPTO system. Aside from basic patent application tracking, PatentBat also holds the potential to serve as a submission tool to facilitate users making electronic submissions of their third party prior art references.
